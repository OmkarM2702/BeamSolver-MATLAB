# BeamSolver-MATLAB

*BeamSolver-MATLAB* is a MATLAB-based tool for analyzing beams under different types of loads. It provides graphical outputs of *Shear Force Diagrams (SFD)* and *Bending Moment Diagrams (BMD)* for both cantilever and simply supported beams.

## Features

- Supports the following load types:
  - Point Load
  - Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL)
  - Uniformly Varying Load (UVL)
  - Applied Moment
- Handles:
  - Cantilever beams
  - Simply supported beams
- Automatically generates:
  - Shear Force Diagram (SFD)
  - Bending Moment Diagram (BMD)

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2018 or later

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the beam_analysis.m file.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script:
   ```matlab
   beam_analysis
